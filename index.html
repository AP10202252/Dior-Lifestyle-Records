  <!-- ===== HIGHLIGHTS ===== -->
<section class="highlights section-pad reveal">
  <h2>🔥 Real Highlights</h2>
  <p>Founders <strong>Luis Abernathy</strong>, <strong>Mfanelo Rikhotso</strong>, <strong>Tristan Jacobsen</strong> and <strong>Kay Jay the Quiet Kid</strong> who freestyled the hit single “WAR” in just 17 minutes—moving 7,000 units in its first week without a major label push. That relentless energy fuels everything we do.</p>
  <p>From recording freestyles on his phone for hours to building a full studio and launching <strong>DIOR Lifestyle Records</strong> and its academy, Kay Jay’s grind started young. He began rapping at age 12, and by 19 he was already being recognized for his raw talent, unique flows, and work ethic that sets him apart from the rest.</p>
  <p>Kay Jay recorded songs like “Renegade Freestyle” in a single take and “Ball Till I Fall” with a hook that became a fan anthem. Every song blends emotion, aggression, and truth—built without a pen, built from life.</p>
  <p>Today, DIOR Lifestyle is more than a label—it’s a movement. Under Kay Jay’s leadership, we’ve launched music that resonates across South Africa and beyond, while giving independent artists the tools and mentorship to break through on their own terms.</p>
  <p>This is not industry-standard. This is <strong>legend-building</strong>.</p>

  <!-- ===== SUCCESS STORIES ===== -->
 <section class="success-stories section-pad reveal">
  <h2>Success Stories</h2>
  <p>From viral breakout tracks to sold‑out showcases, DIOR Lifestyle Records has become a launchpad for unstoppable talent. What started as an independent dream has grown into a movement shaping the future of South African music—one artist at a time.</p>

  <p>Our founder, <strong>Kay Jay the Quiet Kid</strong>, set the tone by turning raw talent into real numbers—moving over 7,000 units in one week with no major label, no gimmicks, just pure skill and consistency. His story inspired a wave of up-and-coming artists who now call DIOR Lifestyle home.</p>

  <p>Our alumni have gone on to land playlist placements on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Audiomack, perform on stages across Gauteng and Limpopo, and earn loyal fanbases through authentic storytelling and bold creative direction. Some have even secured sync licensing opportunities, viral moments, and collaboration requests from top-tier artists and producers—all through a system built to spotlight real artistry, not industry politics.</p>

  <p>Every artist who passes through the DIOR Lifestyle Academy receives personal mentorship, access to high-end production tools, and the opportunity to grow their brand and their sound. Whether it's your first song or your next tour, our platform is designed to help you level up and break through.</p>

  <p>DIOR Lifestyle success isn’t just measured by views or streams—it’s measured by impact, by growth, and by the respect these artists earn for staying true to themselves in a copy-paste industry. When our artists win, they don’t just trend—they lead.</p>

  <p>This is how we create legends, not just moments.</p>
