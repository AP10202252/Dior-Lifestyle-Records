    <h1>About DIOR LIFESTYLE RECORDS</h1>
    <p>We cultivate icons — not trends. Discover the ethos, mission, and vision driving our movement.</p>

<!-- Main Content -->
<section class="content reveal">
  <p><strong>Dior Lifestyle Records</strong> and the <strong>Dior Lifestyle Music Academy</strong> stand as more than just a label and school — they represent a new era of independence, creativity, 
    and power in South African music. Founded by <strong>Luis Abernathy</strong>, <strong>Tristan Jacobsen</strong>, <strong>Mfanelo Rikhotso</strong>, and <strong>Kay Jay the Quiet Kid</strong>, 
    the movement began with one goal: to create a space where undiscovered talent could rise without limits — a space where artists don’t just dream, they build.</p> <p>What started as a bold idea
      in a small bedroom studio evolved into a full-force creative empire. The founders came together from different backgrounds, connected by one shared vision — to redefine what it means to be independent. 
      Each founder brought something unique to the table: leadership, sound, creativity, and a relentless hunger to change the game. Together, 
      they turned Dior Lifestyle into a hub where raw potential meets professional development, and ambition meets opportunity.</p> <p>At the heart of Dior Lifestyle lies a belief that <strong>the youth are the future of
        music</strong> — and that future deserves structure, guidance, and access. Talent alone isn’t enough. The difference between being gifted and being great is the environment you grow in. 
        That’s why our academy doesn’t just teach the music — it teaches the mindset. We train young artists to move with <strong>discipline, focus, and authenticity</strong>, 
        because real success starts long before the fame. We don’t believe in shortcuts; we believe in foundation.</p> <p>The <strong>Dior Lifestyle Music Academy</strong> is 
          designed for creators at every stage — from high school dreamers recording on their phones to rising artists already performing at events. Through workshops, mentorship, and real-world studio 
          experience, we give our students the tools to record, release, and manage their own music with confidence. We focus on <em>creative freedom, business awareness, and consistency</em>, ensuring that every artist 
          who walks through our doors leaves with more than just skills — they leave with purpose.</p> <p>Our <strong>record label</strong> division operates with the same energy. We sign talent based on skill, passion, and originality — 
            not numbers, clout, or image. Whether it’s through the academy or direct discovery, every artist we sign becomes part of a growing movement that values <strong>artistry over popularity</strong>. 
            Our team works hand-in-hand with artists to develop their sound, brand, and career path, because we don’t just want to make hits — we want to build legacies.</p> 
  <p><strong>Dior Lifestyle</strong> is still considered underground, but the impact speaks volumes. Every drop, every freestyle, and every project adds to a story that’s only getting started. 
    We’ve built something real — a family of creators driven by <strong>discipline, impact, and legacy</strong>. And while others chase trends, we’re building timelessness. 
    We represent those who were told they couldn’t, those who had to make a way when no door was open. </p> <p>From humble beginnings to industry recognition, our journey is proof that with consistency, 
      authenticity, and faith in your craft, you don’t need a major label to move like one. This is more than music — it’s a movement. This is <strong>Dior Lifestyle Records</strong> —
      where dreams evolve, talent transforms, and artists become legends.</p>
